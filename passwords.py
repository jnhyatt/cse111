# My addition to the assignment is to add unicode support. It's much, much harder to guess a
# password that may have characters from other languages in it. Many languages have a concept of
# cased letters, so we can still satisfy the basic requirements to check for upper and lower case
# letters. In practice, there are better ways to classify unicode password strength, but this will
# pass the test cases. ðŸ˜€
